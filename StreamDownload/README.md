# Audio Files - External Hosting Required

Due to GitHub's file size limitations (100MB per file), the audio files in this directory need to be hosted externally.

## Recommended Solutions:

### 1. **SoundCloud** (Recommended)
- Upload your mixes to SoundCloud
- Use their embed player in your website
- Benefits: Free, built for music, good player interface

### 2. **Google Drive**
- Upload files to Google Drive
- Make them publicly shareable
- Use direct download links

### 3. **Dropbox**
- Similar to Google Drive
- Good for direct streaming

### 4. **CDN Services**
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Cloudinary
- Firebase Storage

## How to Replace Audio Files:

1. **Upload your MP3 files** to your chosen service
2. **Get the direct URLs** for each file
3. **Update the HTML files** - replace local paths like:
   ```html
   <audio src="StreamDownload/filename.mp3" controls>
   ```
   
   With external URLs:
   ```html
   <audio src="https://external-service.com/path/to/filename.mp3" controls>
   ```

## Files that need updating:
- `index.html` (all 8 volumes)
- Any other pages with audio players
